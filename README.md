GDP2014
=======

This *WAS* the code from the 2014 to 2015 "Game Development - Advanced Programming" classes at Fanshawe College (the ones I taught, anyway)
www.fanshawec.ca/en/GDP1

The code here *ISN'T* current (at all). The current code is in a private repository called "GDP2014_2015". 

If you're not a student, but would still like to have access to it, please e-mail me, and we can chat about it: mfeeney (at) fanshawec.ca 

If you just want to see what we're up to, please go to www.graduategaming.com.



Fanshawe College is in London, Ontario, Canada, Earth.
