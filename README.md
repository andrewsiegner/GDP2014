GDP2014
=======

This *WAS* the code from the 2014 to 2015 "Game Development - Advanced Programming" classes at Fanshawe College (the ones I taught, anyway)
www.fanshawec.ca/en/GDP1

This code is mainly what was presented in class during the year.

The Plan was to make it open to everyone, but then I got to wondering about legal issues, people kvetching, etc. 

Also, since we do PlayStation 3 development, there was a risk of putting stuff from the Sony SDK (and that violates our agreement with Sony, I'm pretty sure). 

So *now* the repository is *private* (if you are a student in the program, you will be given access to it). 

If you're not a student, but would still like to have access to it, please e-mail me, and we can chat about it (TBH, I'll likely say a polite, Canadian "no" - because: see below). 

BUUUT if you are just looking to play/see the stuff we don in class, check out www.graduategaming.com 
(which is my own site and is *IN NO WAY* affiliated with or endorsed by Fanshawe College - other than the fact that I happen to work there and teach in/coordinate the game development program).
(You can download the games there, read the blog, watch the videos, just have a great time! Oh yeah!)


Fanshawe College is in London, Ontario, Canada, Earth.
