Code from the 2014 Game Development - Advanced Programming classes at Fanshawe College

This code is mainly what was presented in class during the year.

While there’s an attempt to make the code clear and “self-documenting”, if you didn’t attend the class, it may not be easy to follow (or even make any sense at all). 

The intention is clarity of explaining/demonstrating concepts (usually a specific, single concept per class), not making it fast, sexy, everything-for-everybody, or whatever. 

If you don’t like it, feel free to change your copy of it. 

If you’re expecting it to be 100% bug free, then I’ve got some bad news for you... 

If (when) you find a bug (many bugs), please let me know. 

There's other stuff related to the program at www.graduategaming.com (which is my own site and in no way affiliated with Fanshawe - other than the fact that I happen to work there and teach in that program).

Fanshawe College is in London, Ontario, Canada, Earth.
